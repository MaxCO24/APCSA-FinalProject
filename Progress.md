# Progress Update
### Whats Done
- We've got a working chess board with pieces
- Uses a JFrame grid and maps each piece (a unicode character) to it's respective location on the board 

### What's Next
- The 1st step is to make a mouse listener that lets users drag pieces
- From there we'll have to fix the set of possible moves to what's legal and identify checks/checkmates
- Then we should probably go back and change the unicode pieces to actual images of chess pieces
- Once that's done we can move on to the chessbot :)
